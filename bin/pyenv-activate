# Summary: Activate virtual environment
#
# Usage: pyenv activate <virtualenv>
#        pyenv activate --unset
#
# Activate a Python virtualenv environment in current shell.
# This acts almost as same as `pyenv shell`, but this invokes the `activate`
# script in your shell.
#
# <virtualenv> should be a string matching a Python version known to pyenv.
